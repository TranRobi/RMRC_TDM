          Our robot’s body is entirely 3D printed, which makes it easier to
          reproduce our work. The 3-layer plexiglass structure we used in
          the previous year cost us a great deal, because it was difficult
          to change batteries, therefor we opted for a box design.

          It uses a Raspberry Pi 4B+ as its onboard computer. There were no
          issues with this single board computer in the previous year, aside
          from some rather embarrassing software problems that we
          detail elsewhere in our TDM. We initially planned on using the
          new Raspberry Pi 5, however its lack of hardware video encoding,
          availability and its newness in general were concerns for us,
          while its improvements didn’t really matter for our case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pi 5 promises much better performance, PCIe, two DSI camera
          ports. None of our components use PCIe nor would they benefit from
          them (I2C’s 100kbit/s speed is more than enough). The better
          performance is always welcome, however the only code running on
          our robot is a daemon that receives commands via a TCP connection
          and controls our motors and arm (each command has been

          that captures from a webcam, transcodes the video using the Pi’s
          hardware encoder and streams it over a TCP connection. The extra DSI
          camera port is pretty much moot, we can simply use an USB webcam.

          power supplies, an MCP23017 integrated circuit to provide extra
          GPIO lines for stepper motors, a webcamera, and a 3D printed robot
          arm. For motor control, we use an L298N integrated circuit. We use
          an MQ-135-M smoke sensor for CO2 sensing.
