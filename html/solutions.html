					<h1>Problems we encountered and our solutions</h1>
					<div class="paragraphs">
						<p>
							We interact with our robot using a few custom programs, named
							KókányControl (kokanyctl) and KókányRecognize (kokanyrecognize).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraphs">
						<p>
							KókányControl has a graphical interface for displaying the video
							and the sensor data it receives from Kókánybot. It takes keyboard
							input, and sends commands to the Raspberry Pi. It also recognizes
							QR codes that appear on Kókánybot’s camera.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraphs">
						<p>
							KókányRecognize was written to reduce the complexity of
							KókányControl, since image recognition functionality is only
							needed in a few runs, and we can just launch KókányRecognize
							whenever we need it. This also enabled us to build KókányControl
							in pure C, since we would have needed to use C++ to build the
							image recognition bits (which uses OpenCV).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraphs">
						<p>The robot can be controlled via WiFi (2.4Ghz) or Ethernet.</p>
					</div>

						<h2>Setup and packup of the robot and operator station</h2>
						<p>
							To set up the robot, we charge the 18650 batteries, put them into
							the battery pack, and flip a switch on our robot.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the operating station, we use a laptop. We connect to our
							portable WiFi router, and access the onboard computer’s web
							interface.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paragraphs">
						<h2>Mission strategy</h2>
						<p>
							We use standard, easily acquirable parts, which makes our robot
							truly rapidly manufacturable.

						<h2>Experiments and Testing</h2>
						<p>
							We have conducted image recognition tests, and tested the movement
							of our robot in our school. Our image recognition model
							successfully recognized hazmat labels with an 80% accuracy.

						<h2>Strengths and real-life applications</h2>
						<p>
							We focused on making our robot compact, easily manufacturable and
							well-rounded, with portable software so the same program can be
							used with different single board computers. For image recognition,
							we trained our own model based on the YoloV8 framework’s small
							starting model. This reduces the processing power needed to do
							inference, enabling less powerful hardware to be used (we
							demonstrated this in the previous competition by using a 2 core 4
							thread Thinkpad T410).

						<h2>What the team has learned so far</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>
								We gained experience with Fusion360 and TinkerCAD and 3D
								printing
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Instead of Python, we opted for C for the core functionality
									which enabled us to learn a lot about interacting with
									hardware at a lower level:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Using standard Linux APIs</li>
									<li>Using I2C to communicate with integrated circuits</li>
									<li>Reading datasheets</li>
									<li>
										Learned to embed FFmpeg in C programs using their various
